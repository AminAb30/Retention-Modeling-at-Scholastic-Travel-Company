# Retention-Modeling-at-Scholastic-Travel-Company

## Project Aim
The project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether customers of the Scholastic Travel Company (STC), an educational tourism firm, will book trips again in the following school year (2013–14). The goal is to use this model to design a targeted marketing strategy that optimizes costs and improves customer retention.

## Key Questions
### Primary Question:
Can we predict which customers will renew their contracts and book another trip with STC based on historical data and customer profiles?

### Secondary Questions:
What customer attributes and trip characteristics influence retention?
How can the predictions guide marketing strategies to improve efficiency and yield?
## What Needs to Be Solved
### Prediction Model Development:
Create a machine learning model using historical data (from the 2012–13 school year) to predict customer retention for 2013–14.

### Feature Selection and Analysis:
Identify and analyze the variables from the dataset that significantly impact customer retention.

### Model Accuracy and Performance:
Ensure the model's predictions are accurate enough to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.

### Marketing Strategy Optimization:
Use the model's output to tailor marketing campaigns towards specific customer segments, reducing marketing costs and improving customer engagement.

## Available Data
The dataset includes:

+ Customer Profiles: School information, teacher details, and trip details.
+ Trip Characteristics: Departure/return dates, travel type, tuition costs, and group revenue.
+ Historical Retention Data: Information on whether the customer group returned in the following year.
This project requires using statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns, evaluate performance, and deploy the results for strategic planning.
